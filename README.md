### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [dr. Tim van Erven](https://www.timvanerven.nl/).
My main topic of research is Mathematical Machine Learing, with a focus on developping formal methods and guarentees
in the field of interpretable machine learning/explainable artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I also am interested
in Online Learning, Bandit algorithms and Causality.

Lately, I am getting more interested in the practical sides of ML and AI. Building the tools that practictioners 
can use to quickly and reliably implement the latest models is what gets me excited!
