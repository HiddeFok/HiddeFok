### Hi there 👋

I am a Researcher in Machine Learning and AI and recently obtained my PhD, supervised by [dr. Tim van Erven](https://www.timvanerven.nl/).
My main topic of research is Mathematical Machine Learing, with a focus on developping formal methods and guarentees
in the field of interpretable machine learning/explainable artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I also am interested
in Optimisation, Online Learning, Bandit algorithms and Causality.

Now that I am finished with my PhD and after having done theoretical research, I am excited about actually
implementing ML algorithms. Currently, I am working on writing multiple repositories that contain 
some of the algorithms I find interesting from ML theory papers. The goal is to write
user-friendly interfaces, with clear documentation and insightfull examples.
